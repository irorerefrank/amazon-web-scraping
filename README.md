# Amazon Web Scraping (Python)

This project shows how Python can be used to scrape product information from Amazon for analysis purposes.

I built this project to practice web scraping with real-world HTML pages and to work with unstructured data in a practical way.

## Project Overview
The notebook collects product-level information from Amazon product pages, including:
- Product name
- Price
- Ratings
- Availability (where applicable)

The data is then organized and explored using Python.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Requests
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
- Send HTTP requests to Amazon product pages
- Parse page content using BeautifulSoup
- Extract relevant product details
- Store the scraped data in a structured format for analysis

## Notes
This project is for learning and demonstration purposes only.  
Website structures may change over time, which can affect scraping results.

## What I Learned
- How to work with real-world web data
- How to extract and clean unstructured HTML content
- How to organize scraped data using Pandas for analysis
